 Objective

The overall goal of this internship is to strengthen practical C++ programming skills through real-world projects covering **file handling**, **multithreading & performance optimization**, **game development**, and **compiler design basics**. These tasks aim to improve coding proficiency, logical thinking, and problem-solving while familiarizing you with important development tools and libraries.
